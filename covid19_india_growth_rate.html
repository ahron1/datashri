		<h1>Rate of growth of COVID-19 cases in India</h1>

		<p>
		Date: 27 March 2020<br>
		Last update: 08 April 2020 <br>
		</p>

		<div class="intro_points"></div>
		<div class="intro_text">
			By 8 April 2020, India has more than 5000 COVID19 infections reported. 
			As of 02 April, the number of reported COVID19 infections in India had crossed 2000. 
			About 3 weeks back, this number was about 200. 
			Between 01 March and 02 April, the number of infections have doubled roughly every 4-5 days. In the days between April 5 - April 8, the growth somewhat slowed down. 
			<br>
			<br>
		
			This is typical in epidemics - the number of infections grows exponentially before starting to gradually plateau. 
			This is one of the reasons it is common to model the number of infections with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_function">sigmoid curve</a> (as illustrated below) 
		</div>
				<figure>
					<img src="sigmoid.png" alt="Sigmoid curve example - researchgate.net" title="Sigmoid curve example" width="360">
					<figcaption>
						<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tali_Leibovich-Raveh/publication/325868989/figure/fig2/AS:639475206074368@1529474178211/A-Basic-sigmoid-function-with-two-parameters-c1-and-c2-as-commonly-used-for-subitizing.png">Sigmoid curve example</a>
					</figcaption>
				</figure>
		<br>
		<div class="intro_text">
			As can be seen in the illustration above, sigmoidal curves can have different degrees of steepness and can plateau off at various levels too.
			The varying levels of steepness and levels of plateauing off are modelled by the parameters of the sigmoid curve - with each set of parameters representing a certain steepness and plateau.
			It is still too early to match the COVID19 infections in India with a specific set of parameters. 
			Since the infection is still in its early stages, the future rate of growth is still unknown. 
			<br>
			<br>
			Left entirely unchecked, it can rise exponentially till it has infected everyone. 
			If measures are taken to curb the spread of the infection, it can indeed start to plateau off earlier. 
			This is the biggest motivation behind the lockdowns imposed as a preventive measure in various places throughout the world.
			<br>
			<br>
			To be sure, in the very long term, the infection will get to everyone - just like the common cold or the flu or seasonal viral fevers.
			The idea is to slow down the current rate of growth to a level that the healthcare system can actually handle. 
			Since the Indian public healthcare system is not as well funded or furnished as in some other places, it is prudent to impose preventive measures earlier on than in other places.

			Below we look at figures demonstrating the number of COVID19 cases in India as well as details of the rate of growth.

					<ul>
					<li><i>i</i> is the number of days since the starting point in this analysis (March 5)</li>

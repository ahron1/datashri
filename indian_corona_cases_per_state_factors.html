		<h1>Corona virus (COVID-19) cases in Indian states relative to various factors </h1>

		<p>
			Last updated: 22 March 2020
		</p>
		<div id="first_text">
			<p>
				Corona virus (COVID-19) infections seem to be picking up in India.
				The situation in India is still better compared to many other countries around the world. 
				However, this is no reason to relax and let go of care and caution.
				The Indian healthcare system simply cannot handle a large scale outbreak. 
				A mass breakout of Corona infections in India will inevitably lead to an uncontrolled situation. 
				A disaster. 
				Hence, preventing the spread of the infection remains the only hope. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Not just a developing country like India, but no country in the world has a public healthcare system which is adequately "prepared" to handle a mass outbreak. 
				A true large scale fatal contagious infectious disease will kill just as large a percentage of people today as did the Black Death in medieval Europe. 
				We believe this is a rather telling tale of the "story of human progress" since the middle ages.
				All the advancements of science and technology, and humanity still can't handle a terrible flu!
			</p>
			<p>
				The government is already taking many steps to handle the situation.
				While there is always ample scope to criticize the ineptitude of the Indian bureaucracy, its actions in this case actually seem to be effective. 
				Within the country, there already seems to be a fair amount of caution. 
				Most, if not all, gathering places have been shut down for a few days/weeks.
				A number of prominent temples, offices, institutions, workplaces have either closed their doors or severely restricted the inflow of people.
				Indeed, social isolation seems to be the new trend. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Within India, different states have been differently affected. 
				Some states report just 1-2 cases, while others have tens of victims. 

				We will take a graphic look at which states are the most affected and at some other variables that might be correlated to the number of cases.

					<b>	Considering the number of cases per 10 crore (100 million) of population:</b>
					<li>This figure has been mathematically "extrapolated". </li>
					<li><b>So for states which have a population of less than 10 crore, the extrapolated figure will be higher than the actual total number of cases in the state.</b></li>
					<li>The country has over 342 cases in a population of 134 crore.
						This translates to an average 25.5 per 10 crore. At the time of last update (19 March), this average figure was about 13 cases per population of 10 crore. 
					</li>
					<li>The Union Territory of Ladakh dwarfs the other states by a huge margin</li>
					<li>This tiny region has a population of 2,74,000 (274,000) and 13 infected cases</li>
					<li><b>This translates/extrapolates to a figure of over 4700 per 10 crore population. </b></li>
					<li>Compared to this, the next highest is Chandigarh with a total of 6 cases (up from 1 case as at 19 March) - which translates to 532 per 10 crore given the population of 11,26,705 (1,126,705)</li>
					<li>Delhi now has 163 cases per 10 crore (based on 30 cases in the population of over 1.8 crore)</li>
				</p>

				<p>
					The Ladakh situation is particularly concerning considering the meager healthcare facilities in the state. 
					This situation is further worsened by the region being hard-to-access during the winter months.
				</p>
				<p>
					In order to be able to get a look at the other states, the next chart artificially removes the figures for Ladakh and Chandigarh
					(the real figure for Ladakh is over 4700, and the second highest after Ladakh is Chandigarh at 532).

				<h4>The Ladakh puzzle...</h4>
					<p>
						<ul>
							Overall, the number of cases in each state seems to have some relation to some explanatory factors, as explored above. Except Ladakh. 
						</ul>
						<ul>
							Ladakh has a high number of cases and the highest number of cases per 10 crore population. 
						</ul>
						<ul>
							But it ranks very low in rankings of population, NSDP, foreign remittances, etc. 
						</ul>
						<ul>
							Looking across various possible variables, we want to find something that might possibly explain this situation. Essentially, we are looking at a category in which Ladakh ranks high, possibly the highest. 
						</ul>
						<ul>
							When it comes to the number of foreign tourists relative to the population, Ladakh takes the lead. The region has a population of about 2,74,000 and received around 50,000 foreign tourists in 2018. Assuming that this reflects a general trend, this gives it the highest ratio of foreign tourists to local population of all Indian regions.
						</ul>
						<ul><b>
							So now, we want to look at the number of cases per 10 crore population relative to the ratio of foreign tourists to the state's population.
							</b>
						</ul>

						The chart above shows the number of cases per 10 crore population in increasing order. Juxtaposed with it is the ratio of foreign tourists to local population. 
						<br>
						Since the cases per 10 crore figure for Ladakh (4744) is extremely high, it is manually adjusted down to 744 (still the highest) to bring some visibility to the other states. 
						<br>
						<br>
						The Y-axis for the ratio of foreign tourists to population is on the right.
						The Y-axis for the number of cases per 10 crore population is on the left. 
						<br>
						<br>
						One can see a bit of a trend indicating that the ratio of foreign tourists to state population also seems to be somewhat in increasing order, albeit a bit sporadically. 

						<li>To check if this visual trend is indeed borne out by the numbers, we look at the correlation. Indeed, the ratio of foreign tourists to state population and the number of cases per 10 crore have a strong correlation of <b>0.68</b>.  
						</li>
						<li>
							We need to be sure that this correlation is meaningful. At a confidence level of 95%, the P-value from a single-factor ANOVA analysis of the two series is 0.2 while the F-value 1.7 is not higher than the critical F-value of 4.1.
						</li>
						<li>
							Alas, while there is a correlation (and a seemingly strong one), the correlation is not "significant".

							So it is not valid to conclude that the ratio of foreign tourists to population is a good predictor of the number of cases (per 10 crore population) in the state. 
						</li>
						<li>
							But this little factoid does seem to fit the Ladakh story well... And that is a quandary often encountered in quantitative analyses.

			<h4>In conclusion:</h4>
			<p>
			<ul>The level of foreign remittances seems to be the best predictor of Corona cases in Indian states. 
			</ul>
			<ul>
				This is in line with what one might expect - considering that the first cases have come from abroad.
			</ul>
			<ul>
				However, it must be stressed that this only considers the initial cases of the infection - the Stage I and Stage II cases.
			</ul>
			<ul>
				The further spread of the disease depends entirely on other factors - like taking adequate precautions. A single case can spread to the entire state if people are careless enough, and a moderate number of cases can be contained if people are careful enough.
			</ul>

		<h2>
			Performance of Indian Large Cap Mutual Funds during the 2020 Corona-Crash.
		</h2>

		<p>
			Date: 15 March 2020
		</p>

		<p>
			The panic surrouding the 2019 Novel Coronavirus has caused routs in the financial markets in 2020. 
			In particular equity markets seem to be the hardest hit.
			Carnage of such levels haven't been seen since at least 2008, possibly ever, in the Indian markets. 
			Things are still in a tailspin as at the time of this writing. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>For investors who prefer mutual funds</b> over stock-picking, it is the performance of various funds that matters most.
			For the benefit of such investors, we will undertake a quick performance analysis to see which funds have battered the storm better than their peers. 
			In particular, we will look into Indian Large Cap equity mutual funds. 
		</p>

		<div class="warning">
			STATUTORY WARNING: Over-confidence in quantitative analyses can be injurious to your wealth. Invest with care and caution. 
		</div>

		<p>
			<h4>
				For the four week time period from Friday 14 Feb 2020 to Friday 13 March 2020, the following items will be checked:
			</h4>
			<div class="bullet_list">
				<li>Comparison of absolute returns of the different funds </li>
				<li>Comparison of volatities (in NAV) of the different funds</li>
				<li>Correlation analysis of (daily) fund NAVs with the benchmark</li>
			</div>

		</p>
		<p>
			<h4>
				The constraints of this performance analysis are:
			</h4>

			<div class="bullet_list">
			<li>The benchmark for this analysis will be the closing values of the NSE 100 Large Cap Index. This index may or may not be the benchmark that the individual funds track. </li>
			<li>For each fund being analysed, the performance of the "Direct - Growth" plan (or equivalent) will be considered.  </li>
			<li>To avoid visual/information overload, a total of only eight funds will be looked at.</li>
			<li>In selecting which funds to include in the analysis, certain arbitrary criteria (rating, historical performance, personal preference, ease of using their website, etc.) were imposed.  </li>
			</div>
		</p>


		<div class="graphics_results">
			<h4>Comparison of fund returns during the period</h4>
			
			<div id="returns_chart">
			</div>

			<div class="bullet_list">
				<p>
					<b>	Looking at the returns generated by the different funds:</b>
					<li>Our benchmark NIFTY 100 Index lost 17.8%. </li>
					<li>Compared to this, the average return of the eight funds was a loss of 15.3%. </li>
					<li>Individually, the Axis Bluechip Fund was the best performer in this period, with a loss of 12%.</li>
					<li>The Nippon India Largecap Fund was the biggest loser, with negative returns of over 19%.</li>
				</p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="graphics_results">
			<h4>Comparison of fund volatilities during the period</h4>

			<div id="stddevs_chart">
			</div>
			<div class="bullet_list">
				<p>
					<b>	Considering the volatilities (as measured by population standard deviation of the returns) of the different funds:</b>
					<li>Our benchmark NIFTY 100 Index had a standard deviation (SD) of 2.6%. </li>
					<li>Compared to this, the average volatility of the eight funds was 2.3%. </li>
					<li>Individually, the Axis Bluechip Fund was the least volatile during period, with an SD of 1.8%.</li>
					<li>The Nippon India Largecap Fund was the most volatile, with an SD of 2.7%.</li>
				</p>

				<p>
					The SD figures indicate that the funds (and index) were all subject to similar levels of volatility.
					This is because, as is typical in a meltdown, they are all crashing together. 
					This will be further borne out in the correlation analysis below.
				</p>
			</div>

		</div>

		<div class="graphics_results">
				<h4>Fund correlations with the benchmark index</h4>

				<div id="corrs_chart">
				</div>
				<div class="bullet_list">
					<p>
						<b>The returns generated by the funds are all strongly correlated with the benchmark index returns.</b>
						<li>Individually, the Mirae Largecap Fund was the most strongly correlated to the benchmark, with a correlation coefficient of 0.998.</li>
						<li>The Nippon India Largecap Fund was the least strongly correlated to the index, with a coefficient of 0.983.</li>
						<li>The differences in correlations with index returns are not very significant.</li>
					</p>

					<p>
						The correlation coefficients indicate that the funds were all strongly correlated with the benchmark.
					</p>
				</div>

		</div>

		<div id="conclusion">
			<h4>In conclusion:</h4>
			There were some differences in the performances of individual funds, as can be seen in the returns and volatilities above.
			But overall, all the funds have behaved almost equally depressingly - as is typical during a meltdown.

		<h1>Level of hospital facilities in Indian states relative to income and population</h1>

		<p>
		Date: 21 March 2020<br>
			Last update: 23 March 2020
		</p>

		<p>
			What decides the level of public  hospital facilities in each Indian state? 
			<br>
			<br>
			Is it the population of the state? Perhaps states with more people should have more hospital facilities..
			<br>
			Or is it perhaps related to the relative wealth of the state (as proxied by Net State Domestic Product) or its people (as proxied by the per capita income)? Maybe richer states have built more hospital facilities for their people..
			<br>
			Or could it perhaps be the per capita incomes - states with more rich people need fewer public hospitals? 
			<br>
			How about the state's public health expenditure? One would suppose that the more money a state spends, the more hospital beds it ought to have..



		</p>
		<p>
			Let's check the data and find out. 
			As a proxy for public hospital facilities, we use the number of beds in government-run hospitals in each state. 
			In part, this is because this is the best low-level data we can find on this topic. 
			Relatively serious patients are typically admitted to the hospital instead of being given a prescription in the "Out Patient Department" and sent home to recuperate. 
			Also, at least anecdotally, hospitals seem to have at least some nursing staff and doctors dedicated to the various wards. 
		</p>

		<p id="data_sources">
			We use the following sources of data in this analysis: 

				<ul>
					Data on NSDP and per capita income of each state is taken from <a href="https://pib.gov.in/newsite/printrelease.aspx?relid=169546">the PIB website</a> and dates to 2014-15.
				</ul>

				<ul>
					Data on number of hospital beds in government run hospitals is taken from <a href="https://data.gov.in/resources/stateut-wise-number-government-hospital-beds-facilities-rural-and-urban-areas-reply">data.gov.in</a> and dates to 2019. 
				</ul>
				<ul>
					Data on statewise population is taken from <a href="http://statisticstimes.com/demographics/population-of-indian-states.php">statisticstimes.com</a>
				</ul>
				<ul>
					Data on public health expenditure is taken from <a href="https://data.gov.in/resources/state-wise-public-health-expenditure-during-2016-17-2017-18-ministry-health-and-family">data.gov.in</a>

					<b>Looking closely at the chart, one can see that there is almost certainly some relation between the NSDP and number of hospital beds in the state.
						Columns representing both NSDP and number of beds seem to be increasing together (The data is sorted such that the NSDPs are in ascending order).
					</b>
					<li>Eyeballing the graph to spot trends is always a good idea, but we also want to look at the correlation to confirm our suspicion.</li>
					<li>Indeed, the correlation between the state NSDP and the number of government hospital beds is seen to be high at <b>0.83.</b></li>
					<li>Looking more closely, based on ANOVA single-factor analysis with alpha 0.05, the P-value is 6.3E-06 and the F-value of 24.2 is higher than the F-critical value of 4.
						This confirms that the strength of the correlation is significant at a confidence level of 95%. 

					</li>

					<br>
					<b>So it can indeed be concluded that richer states build more medical facilities for their people. </b>

					<br>
					<br>
					Some further minor observations from the chart above:
					<li>
						The states of West Bengal, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu seem to have a rather high number of hospitals relative to the state income. 
					</li>
					<li>
						One can indeed <i>speculate</i> that the situation of West Bengal might possibly be explained by the socialist tradition of the state. 

					</li>
					<li>
						In the case of Uttar Pradesh, it might also be <i>speculated</i> that the situation is explained by the large population combined with the relatively lower income of the state. 
						The next chart/analysis will shed a bit more light on this point.

					So as the next step, we check the correlation.</li>
					<li>The correlation between the state's per capita income and the number of government hospital beds is <b>-0.18</b></li>
					<li>Looking more closely, based on ANOVA single-factor analysis with alpha 0.05, the P-value is 5.3E-12 and the F-value of 71.3 is greater than the F-critical value of 4.
					</li>
					<li>
						This indicates a significant but weakly negative correlation between the per capita income of the state and the number of hospital beds.
					</li>
					<br>
					<li>
						This can be interpreted as: <b>to a certain extent, states with lower per capita income have higher level of government hospital facilities.</b>

					<b>Looking closely at the chart, one can see that there seems to be some relation between the state population and number of hospital beds in the state.
						Columns representing both population and number of beds seem to be increasing somewhat together (The data is sorted such that the populations are in ascending order).
					</b>
					<li>Eyeballing the graph to spot trends is always a good idea, but we also want to look at the correlation to confirm our suspicion.</li>
					<li>Indeed, the correlation between the state population and the number of government hospital beds is seen to be high at <b>0.77.</b></li>
					<li>Looking more closely, based on ANOVA single-factor analysis with alpha 0.05, the P-value is 1.3E-05 and the F-value of 22.3 is higher than the F-critical value of 4.

					<b>Graphically, the chart displays decent correlation between the number of hospital beds and the public health expenditure of the state.	</b>
					<li>Compared to the other states, the states of Bihar and Chattisgarh seem to have a higher health expense relative to the number of hospital beds.
					</li>
					<li>The states of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal appear to have much more hospital beds relative to their public health expense - compared to the other states.</li>

					<li>The correlation between the state public health expenditure and the number of government hospital beds is very high at <b>0.83</b></li>
					<li>Looking more closely, based on ANOVA single-factor analysis with alpha 0.05, the P-value is 0.0002 and the F-value of 15.8 is higher than the F-critical value of 4.
						This confirms that the strength of the correlation is significant at a confidence level of 95%.

					<br>

					<b>So it can be concluded that states with higher public health expenditures build more medical facilities for their people. But there are significant variations in the data. </b>

					<br>
					<br>


					To look into these variations, we compute the "ratio" of public health expenditure to the number of hospital beds. The lower this ratio, the less money the state has spent for each hospital bed.
